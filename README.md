![in process image](filepath)

You can describe the mapmaking process in this section, including images where it helps to describe the process.

Steps in the process:

1. **Collecting and preparing data** – Imported land cover, water bodies, and administrative boundary layers.  
2. **Choosing projections** – Converted data to the British National Grid for consistency.  
3. **Styling features** – Applied color schemes for land cover types (forest, grass, scrub, snow) and selected fonts for labels.  
4. **Zoom-level adjustments** – Configured labels to appear at appropriate zoom levels to avoid clutter.  
5. **Final adjustments and testing** – Reviewed the map for clarity, readability, and visual balance.
